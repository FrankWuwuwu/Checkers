# Introduction
This is the Group project of CIS 667 AI class.

Group members:  Kefu Wu,  Shuangding Zhu,  Jiayu Ding

We are implementing checkers with a rule modification and train AI for the game.

We will use **MTCS** and **CNN** to train AI for this project.

**Rule modification: each turn, there is a 10% chance that a player's piece automatically teleports to a random nearby location.**

Currently, only the domain of the game is implemented.

# Required libraries
To run our game, following libraries must be installed.

# How to run the game
The code of the is created by us and is completely original.
To start with, use following code to clone and enter the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/FrankWuwuwu/Checkers
cd Checkers
```
run following code to play checker with simple AI.
```
python play_checker.py
```

# How to run experiment
We will use MTCS and CNN to train AI for checker.

Will be update soon.
